    "I work on production web applications that need to be *reliable, readable,* and easy to evolve. My day-to-day work involves building user-facing features, integrating APIs, and improving performance and stability across the stack.\n\nI’ve handled everything from frontend architecture and state management to fixing backend integration issues, auth flows, and database inefficiencies. Outside of work, I spend time on *photography* and share some of my photos on Instagram."
