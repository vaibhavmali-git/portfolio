  summary:
    "I’m a Software Developer with a deep specialization in React and TypeScript, currently shipping production code at QuadB Technologies. My background spans the full stack—I build clean, accessible UIs, but I’m equally comfortable diving into Node.js backends, optimizing SQL queries, or managing OAuth flows.\n\nMy recent work involves everything from building decentralized finance (DeFi) interfaces to fixing critical server-side authentication issues for mobile apps. I prioritize maintainable code and modular architecture, ensuring that the applications I build are stable, fast, and easy to scale."
