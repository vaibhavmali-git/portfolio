  summary:
    "I’m a *Software Developer* with a deep specialization in React and TypeScript, currently shipping production code at *QuadB Technologies*. My background spans the full stack. I build clean, accessible UIs, but I’m equally comfortable diving into Node.js backends, optimizing SQL queries, or managing OAuth flows.\n\nMy work ranges from shipping scalable features to fixing critical auth and integration issues in production. I care about writing code that’s easy to reason about, reliable under load, and pleasant for teams to maintain."
